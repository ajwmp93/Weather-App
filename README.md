# Weather Application

## Description
I created this project to be able to quickly see the current day's weather and the next 5-days weather to better make current and future plans. This application allows me to type in a city and it will save to my local storage so that if I come back to it later, I can just click on the saved city on the side and it will bring up the forecast again without me having to search for the city again. This project taught me a lot about API's and how to call multiple fetches within each other to get the desired result. 

## Usage
To use this application, type the city you would like to view the weather for in the search bar and hit the search button, your locations 5 day forecast and current weather will be displayed.
